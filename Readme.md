Nabaztag-messenger

Nabaztag rabbit messagenger Project created by Raj Bose, September 2022

This project was created to create tiny versions of the original NABAZTAG rabbit. These tiny versions called NABBY's are part of a home messaging and sensor system connected on Wifi.

This Doorbell cose supports both legacy Nabby's using the legacy commands, and Tiny Nabby's updated command set.

See the Nabby-tiny repository for an extisive description. (https://github.com/rkbose/Nabby-tiny/wiki/Nabby-Rabbit-home-automation-%E2%80%90-Rabbit-as-doorbell-unit)
